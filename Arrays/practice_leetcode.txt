PROBLEM 2011
There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:

++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
Initially, the value of X is 0.

Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.



**** SOLUTION ****
class Solution:
    def finalValueAfterOperations(self, operations: List[str]) -> int:
        X=0
        for i in range(len(operations)):
            a=operations[i]
            if a=="X++" or a=="++X":
                X=X+1
            elif a=="X--" or a=="--X":
                X=X-1 
            i+=1
            continue
        return X     

PROBLEM 1588            

Given an array of positive integers arr, calculate the sum of all possible odd-length subarrays.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

Return the sum of all odd-length subarrays of arr.





**** SOLUTION ****
class Solution:
    def sumOddLengthSubarrays(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
           sum = 0
           l = len(arr)
           for i in range(l):
                for j in range(i, l, 2):
                    for k in range(i, j + 1, 1):
                        sum += arr[k]
           return sum
 


 PROBLEM 1622

Given two string arrays word1 and word2, return true if the two arrays represent the same string, and false otherwise.

A string is represented by an array if the array elements concatenated in order forms the string.

 ***** SOLUTION *****
 class Solution:
    def arrayStringsAreEqual(self, word1: List[str], word2: List[str]) -> bool:
        sum1=""
        sum2=""
        for i in range(len(word1)):
            sum1+=word1[i]
            continue   
        for j in range(len(word2)):
            sum2+=word2[j]
            continue    
        if sum1==sum2:
            return True
        else:
            return False
